## Codebase Patterns
- Migrations use TEXT ids with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP defaults for created/updated timestamps.
- Services must be exported in src-tauri/src/services/mod.rs to be used elsewhere.
- Main navigation uses the MainNav component with NavLink active styling.
- Frontend Tauri commands are wrapped in React Query hooks under src/hooks with stable query keys.
- Scenario comparison projections are fetched per plan via the useRetirementScenarioProjections hook.

## 2026-01-23 00:14 NZDT - US-001
- What was implemented
  - Added retirement_plans migration and RetirementPlan model with camelCase serialization test.
- Files changed
  - src-tauri/migrations/20260122000000_create_retirement_plans.sql
  - src-tauri/src/models.rs
  - README.md
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: models use chrono types with serde camelCase for Tauri payloads.
  - Gotchas encountered: cargo test can be slow; increase timeout if needed.
  - Useful context: migrations use TEXT ids and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP defaults.

## 2026-01-23 00:22 NZDT - US-002
- What was implemented
  - Added RetirementService with return scenarios, compound growth, withdrawal, and years-to-retirement calculations.

- Files changed
  - src-tauri/src/services/retirement.rs
